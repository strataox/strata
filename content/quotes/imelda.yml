    Thank you so much for having me, I genuinely had a great time. It was wonderful spending the evening with such an intentional, thoughtful group. The conversations flowed easily, the energy was warm, and it really felt like a space where people could connect beyond work.

    The food and ambience were a perfect touch, but what stood out most for me was the sense of community and shared purpose in the room. It was refreshing, grounding, and a lovely reminder of the kind of culture Strata is building. I’m grateful to have been part of it and I’m really looking forward to what’s ahead in 2026.
