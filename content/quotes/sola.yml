    Thank you very much, KB. I just got back a short while ago.
    I’m so glad to have joined, witnessing powerful minds shaping operational excellence in the country was amazing.
    The courses were excellent, the restaurant and attendants made it smooth, and the effort didn’t go unnoticed.
    Big shout out to the management for setting this up and helping us create great memories for the new year.
