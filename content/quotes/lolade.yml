    It was cool and refreshing to engage with like minds with no airs. I especially
    liked that it was more like a hangout or team bonding than an uptight dinner.
    I loved hearing the stories of how each guest was connected to Strata and to
    Bode. Kudos to the hosts especially for the icebreaking activities and games.
    They made me feel really warm and cheerful. On a lower note, the food was bland
    but I loved the ambience and the company so I honestly didn't mind it. Thank you
    for having me.
